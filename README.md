# The Library of Toys

The Library of Toys is a subscription based platform for users to rent toys for their children. A user can create an account, add toys to their cart, add unavaible toys to their watchlist, and view order status. Administrators can upload new toys, update existing toys, update existing order statuses.

## Features

Action mailer: 
Automated emails are generated to welcome a newly created user and to inform existing users that their order status has changed. 

## Future Features

In the future this app will include resources to pay subscription fees online and report broken toys.
